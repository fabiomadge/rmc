<p>RMC is a Rust verification tool based on <em>model checking</em>.
With RMC, you can ensure that broad classes of problems are absent from your Rust code by writing <em>proof harnesses</em>, which are broadly similar to tests (especially property tests).
RMC is especially useful for verifying unsafe code in Rust, where many of the language's usual guarantees can no longer be checked by the compiler.
But RMC is also useful for finding panics in safe Rust, and it can check user-defined assertions.</p>
<h2 id="project-status"><a class="header" href="#project-status">Project Status</a></h2>
<p>RMC is currently in the initial development phase, and has not yet made an official release.
It is under active development, but it does not yet support all Rust language features.
(The <a href="./dashboard.html">RMC dashboard</a> can help you understand our current progress.)
If you encounter issues when using RMC we encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/issues/new/choose">report them to us</a>.</p>
<p>RMC usually syncs with the main branch of Rust every week, and so is generally up-to-date with the latest Rust language features.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rmc-installation-guide"><a class="header" href="#rmc-installation-guide">RMC Installation Guide</a></h1>
<p>RMC must currently be built from source.</p>
<p>In general, the following dependencies are required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dependencies needed to built <code>rustc</code>. RMC is a fork of the Rust compiler, and so we have the same minimum requirements.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc">CBMC</a> (&gt;= 5.43.0)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-viewer-for-cbmc">CBMC Viewer</a> (&gt;= 2.6)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: These dependencies may be installed by running the CI scripts shown below and there is no need to install them separately, for their respective OS.</p>
<h2 id="installing-on-ubuntu-2004"><a class="header" href="#installing-on-ubuntu-2004">Installing on Ubuntu 20.04</a></h2>
<p>The simplest way to install (especially if you're using a fresh VM) is following our CI scripts:</p>
<pre><code># git clone git@github.com:model-checking/rmc.git
git clone https://github.com/model-checking/rmc.git
cd rmc
git submodule update --init
./scripts/setup/ubuntu-20.04/install_deps.sh
./scripts/setup/ubuntu-20.04/install_cbmc.sh
./scripts/setup/install_viewer.sh 2.6
./scripts/setup/install_rustup.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="installing-on-mac-os"><a class="header" href="#installing-on-mac-os">Installing on Mac OS</a></h2>
<p>You need to have <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed already.</p>
<pre><code># git clone git@github.com:model-checking/rmc.git
git clone https://github.com/model-checking/rmc.git
cd rmc
git submodule update --init
./scripts/setup/macos-10.15/install_deps.sh
./scripts/setup/macos-10.15/install_cbmc.sh
./scripts/setup/install_viewer.sh 2.6
./scripts/setup/install_rustup.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-and-testing-rmc"><a class="header" href="#building-and-testing-rmc">Building and testing RMC</a></h2>
<p>Perform one-time build configuration:</p>
<pre><code>./configure \
    --enable-debug \
    --set=llvm.download-ci-llvm=true \
    --set=rust.debug-assertions-std=false \
    --set=rust.deny-warnings=false
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE: If you skip the above (<code>llvm.download-ci-llvm=true</code> specifically), builds may take a long time as all of LLVM would need to be built from scratch.</strong></p>
<p>Then build RMC and its library:</p>
<pre><code>./x.py build -i --stage 1 library/std
./scripts/setup/build_rmc_lib.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Then, optionally, run the regression tests:</p>
<pre><code>./scripts/rmc-regression.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This script has a lot of noisy output, but on a successful run you will see:</p>
<pre><code>All RMC regression tests completed successfully.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="try-running-rmc"><a class="header" href="#try-running-rmc">Try running RMC</a></h2>
<p>Get the RMC script in your path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export PATH=$(pwd)/scripts:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>Create a test file:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">// File: test.rs
pub fn main() {
    assert!(1 == 2);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Run RMC on the single file:</p>
<pre><code>rmc test.rs
</code></pre>
<p>You should get a result like this one:</p>
<pre><code>[snipped output]
** Results:
test.rs function main
[main.assertion.1] line 2 assertion failed: 1 == 2: FAILURE

** 1 of 1 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>Fix the test and you should see <code>rmc</code> succeed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="comparison-with-other-tools"><a class="header" href="#comparison-with-other-tools">Comparison with other tools</a></h1>
<p><strong>Fuzzing</strong> (for example, with <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz"><code>cargo-fuzz</code></a>) is a unguided approach to random testing.
A fuzzer generally provides an input of random bytes, and then examines fairly generic properties (&quot;doesn't crash or commit undefined behavior&quot;) about the behavior of the resulting program.
Fuzzers generally get their power through a kind of evolutionary algorithm that rewards new mutant inputs that &quot;discover&quot; new branches of the program under test.
Fuzzers are excellent for testing security boundaries, precisely because they make no validity assumptions (hence &quot;unguided&quot;) when generating the input.</p>
<p><strong>Property testing</strong> (for example, with <a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest"><code>proptest</code></a>) is a guided approach to random testing.
&quot;Guided&quot; in the sense that the test generally provides a strategy (for generating random values) that constrains their range.
The purpose of this is to either focus on interesting values, or because the assertions in the test will only hold for a constrained set of inputs.
This generator is sampled several times, and the test's assertions are checked for each sample.
Tests in this style do actually state properties: &quot;forall inputs (of some constrained kind), this condition should hold.&quot;
Property testing is often quite effective, but the engine can't fully prove the property, it can only sample randomly a few of those values to test (though property testing libraries frequently give interesting &quot;edge cases&quot; higher probability, making them more effective at bug-finding).</p>
<p><strong>Model checking</strong> is similar to these techniques in how you use them, but model checking is non-random and exhaustive (though often only up to some bound on input or problem size).
Thus, properties checked with a model checker are effectively proofs.
Instead of naively trying all possible <em>concrete</em> inputs (which could be infeasible and blow up exponentially), model checkers like RMC will cleverly encode program traces as <em>symbolic</em> &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT</a>&quot; problems, and hand them off to SAT/SMT solvers.
Again, SAT/SMT solving is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">NP-complete</a> problem, but most practical programs can be model checked within milliseconds to seconds (with notable exceptions: you can easily try to reverse a cryptographic hash with a model checker, but good luck getting it to terminate!)</p>
<p>Model checking allows you to prove non-trivial properties about programs, and check those proofs in roughly the same amount of time as a traditional test suite would take to run.
The downside is many types of properties can quickly become &quot;too large&quot; to practically model check, and so writing &quot;proof harnesses&quot; (very similar to property tests and fuzzer harnesses) requires some skill to understand why the solver is not terminating and fix the structure of the problem you're giving it so that it does.
This process basically boils down to &quot;debugging&quot; the proof.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rmc-on-a-single-file"><a class="header" href="#rmc-on-a-single-file">RMC on a single file</a></h1>
<p>For small examples, or initial learning, it's very common to run RMC on just one source file.
The command line format for invoking RMC directly has a few common formats:</p>
<pre><code>rmc filename.rs
# or
rmc filename.rs [--rmc-flags]
# or
rmc filename.rs [--rmc-flags] --cbmc-args [--cbmc-flags]
</code></pre>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>rmc filenames.rs --visualize --cbmc-args --object-bits 11 --unwind 15
</code></pre>
<h2 id="common-rmc-arguments"><a class="header" href="#common-rmc-arguments">Common RMC arguments</a></h2>
<p><strong><code>--visualize</code></strong> will generate a report in the local directory accessible through <code>report/html/index.html</code>.
This report will shows coverage information, as well as give traces for each failure RMC finds.</p>
<p><strong><code>--function &lt;name&gt;</code></strong> RMC defaults to assuming the starting function is called <code>main</code>.
You can change it to a different function with this argument.
Note that to &quot;find&quot; the function given, it needs to be given the <code>#[no_mangle]</code> annotation.</p>
<p><strong><code>--gen-c</code></strong> will generate a C file that roughly corresponds to the input Rust file.
This can sometimes be helpful when trying to debug a problem with RMC.</p>
<p><strong><code>--keep-temps</code></strong> will preserve generated files that RMC generates.
In particular, this will include a <code>.json</code> file which is the &quot;CBMC symbol table&quot;.
This can be helpful in trying to diagnose bugs in RMC, and may sometimes be requested in RMC bug reports.</p>
<h2 id="common-cbmc-arguments"><a class="header" href="#common-cbmc-arguments">Common CBMC arguments</a></h2>
<p>RMC invokes CBMC to do the underlying solving.
(CBMC is the &quot;C Bounded Model Checker&quot; but is actually a framework that supports model checking multiple languages.)
CBMC arguments are sometimes necessary to get good results.</p>
<p>To give arguments to CBMC, you pass <code>--cbmc-args</code> to RMC.
This &quot;switches modes&quot; from RMC arguments to CBMC arguments.
Everything else given on the command line will be assumed to be a CBMC argument, and so all RMC arguments should be provided before this flag.</p>
<p><strong><code>--unwind &lt;n&gt;</code></strong> Give a global upper bound on all loops.
This can force termination when CBMC tries to unwind loops indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong><code>--object-bits &lt;n&gt;</code></strong> CBMC, by default, assumes there are only going to be 256 objects allocated on the heap in a single trace.
This corresponds to a default of <code>--object-bits 8</code>.
Rust programs often will use more than this, and so need to raise this limit.
However, very large traces with many allocations often prove intractable to solve.
If you run into this issue, a good first start is to raise the limit to 2048, i.e. <code>--object-bits 11</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>--unwindset label_1:bound_1,label_2:bound_2,...</code></strong> Give specific unwinding bounds on specific loops.
The labels for each loop can be discovered by running with the following CBMC flag:</p>
<p><strong><code>--show-loops</code></strong> Print the labels of each loop in the program.
Useful for <code>--unwindset</code>.</p>

<p>RMC currently ships with a <code>cargo-rmc</code> script, but this support is deeply limited (e.g. to a single crate).
This will be corrected soon, and this documentation updated.
In the meantime, we document the current build process for a larger project with dependencies here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To build a larger project (one with dependencies or multiple crates) with RMC, you currently need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the project with an appropriate set of flags to output CBMC &quot;symbol table&quot; <code>.json</code> files.</li>
<li>Link these together into a single &quot;goto binary&quot;, with appropriate preprocessing flags.</li>
<li>Directly call CBMC on this resulting binary.</li>
</ol>
<p>We give an example of this kind of script, with explanations, below.</p>
<h1 id="building-and-running"><a class="header" href="#building-and-running">Building and running</a></h1>
<p>Let's assume you have a project you can build with <code>cargo build</code> and you've written a proof harness somewhere in it that you want to run RMC on:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[no_mangle]
#[cfg(rmc)]
fn my_harness() {
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>A sample build script might start like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">set -eux

# The argument to this script will be the proof harness, e.g. 'my_harness' above
ENTRY_POINT=$1

export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target-rmc

env \
  RUST_BACKTRACE=1 \
  RUSTC=rmc-rustc \
  RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-Z trim-diagnostic-paths=no -Z codegen-backend=gotoc --cfg=rmc&quot; \
  cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to re-use the <code>cargo</code> build system, but with flags that override <code>rustc</code> with RMC instead.
More specifically, by setting the <code>RUSTC</code> environment variable to <code>rmc-rustc</code>, each Rust source file targeted by <code>cargo build</code> is &quot;compiled&quot; with RMC instead of <code>rustc</code>.
The result of running <code>rmc-rustc</code> on a source file is a symbol table json file written in the CBMC Goto-C language.
The use of an alternate target directory ensures RMC and rustc don't confuse each other with different intermediate output.</p>
<p>Next we can convert the symbol tables into goto binaries, in parallel, and then link them together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/deps

# Independently translate each symbol table into a goto binary
ls *.json | parallel symtab2gb {} --out {.}.out

# Link everything together
goto-cc *.out -o linked-binary.out
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we have the project built, but now we want to transform it into something that will run a specific proof harness.
To do that, we specialize it, preprocess it, and then run CBMC on the result:
(In practice, we might want to do the above steps once, then repeat the below steps for each proof harness.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Now for each harness we specialize a binary:
HARNESS_BIN=&quot;harness_${ENTRY_POINT}.out&quot;
goto-cc --function ${ENTRY_POINT} linked-binary.out empty.c -o &quot;${HARNESS_BIN}&quot;

# Perform some preprocessing
INSTRUMENT_ARGS=(
  --drop-unused-functions
)
goto-instrument &quot;${INSTRUMENT_ARGS[@]}&quot; &quot;${HARNESS_BIN}&quot; &quot;${HARNESS_BIN}&quot;

# Run CBMC, passing along appropriate CBMC arguments:
CBMC_ARGS=(
  # RMC defaults
  --unwinding-assertions
  --bounds-check
  --pointer-check
  --pointer-primitive-check
  --pointer-overflow-check
  --signed-overflow-check
  --undefined-shift-check
  --unsigned-overflow-check
  --conversion-check
  --div-by-zero-check
  --float-overflow-check
  --nan-check
  # Additional options
  --unwind 0
  --object-bits 11
)

cbmc &quot;${CBMC_ARGS[@]}&quot; &quot;${HARNESS_BIN}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we have a complete script and should now be able to run <code>./sample-rmc-build my_harness</code> to run a particular proof harness.
Even in very large projects the removal of unreachable code should mean only the parts relevant to that proof harness are preserved in the RMC run.</p>

<p>If you're interested in applying RMC, then you're probably in this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>You're working on a moderately important project in Rust.</li>
<li>You've already invested heavily in testing to ensure correctness, and possibly fuzzing to ensure the absence of shallow security issues.</li>
<li>You want to invest further, to gain a much higher degree of assurance.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already, we recommend techniques like property testing (e.g. with <a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest"><code>proptest</code></a>) before attempting model checking.
These yield good results, are very cheap to apply, and are often easier to adopt and debug.
Refactoring work to make your code more property-testable will generally also make the code more model-checkable as well.
RMC is a next step: a tool that can be applied once cheaper tactics are no longer yielding results, or once the easier to detect issues have already been dealt with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tutorial will step you through a progression from simple to moderately complex tasks with RMC.
It's meant to ensure you can get started, and see at least some simple examples of how typical proofs are structured.
It will also teach you the basics of &quot;debugging&quot; proof harnesses, which mainly consists of diagnosing and resolving non-termination issues with the solver.</p>

<p>RMC is unlike the testing tools you may already be familiar with.
Much of testing is concerned with thinking of new corner cases that need to be covered.
With RMC, all the corner cases are covered from the start, and the new concern is narrowing down the scope to something manageable for the checker.</p>

<p>Think about the test harness you would need to write to test this function.
You would need figure out a whole set of arguments to call the function with that would exercise each branch.
You would need to keep that test harness up-to-date with the code, in case some of the branches change.
And if this function was more complicated—for example, if some of the branches depended on global state—the test harness would be even more onerous to write.</p>
<p>We can try to property test a function like this, but if we're naive about it (and consider all possible <code>u32</code> inputs), then it's unlikely we'll ever find the bug.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">

<pre><code># cargo test

</code></pre>
<p>There's only 1 in 4 billion inputs that fail, so it's vanishingly unlikely the property test will find it, even with a million samples.</p>
<p>With RMC, however:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[cfg(rmc)]
#[no_mangle]
fn main() {
    let x: u32 = rmc::nondet();
    estimate_size(x);

VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>RMC has immediately found a failure.
Notably, we haven't had to write explicit assertions in our &quot;proof harness&quot;: by default, RMC will find a host of erroneous conditions which include a reachable call to <code>panic</code> or a failing <code>assert</code>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-trace"><a class="header" href="#getting-a-trace">Getting a trace</a></h3>
<p>By default, RMC only reports failures, not how the failure happened.
This is because, in its full generality, understanding how a failure happened requires exploring a full (potentially large) execution trace.
Here, we've just got some nondeterministic inputs up front, but that's something of a special case that has a &quot;simpler&quot; explanation (just the choice of nondeterministic input).</p>
<p>To see traces, run:</p>
<pre><code>rmc --visualize src/lib.rs
open report/html/index.html
</code></pre>
<p>The first command runs RMC and generates the html-based report in <code>report/</code>.
The second command opens that report in your default browser (on mac, on linux desktops try <code>xdg-open</code>).
From this report, we can find the trace of the failure and filter through it to find the relevant line (at present time, an unfortunate amount of generated code is present in the trace):</p>
<pre><code>let x: u32 = rmc::nondet();
x = 1023u
</code></pre>
<p>Here we're seeing the line of code and the value assigned in this particular trace.
Like property testing, this is just one example of a failure.
To find more, we'd presumably fix this issue and then re-run RMC.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-try-other-failures"><a class="header" href="#exercise-try-other-failures">Exercise: Try other failures</a></h3>
<p>We put an explicit panic in this function, but it's not the only kind of failure RMC will find.
Try a few other types of errors.</p>
<p>For example, instead of panicking we could try explicitly dereferencing a null pointer:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>unsafe { return *(0 as *const u32) };
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Notably, however, the Rust compiler emits a warning here:</p>
<pre><code>warning: dereferencing a null pointer
  --&gt; src/lib.rs:10:29
   |
10 |    unsafe { return *(0 as *const u32) };
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this code causes undefined behavior when executed
   |
   = note: `#[warn(deref_nullptr)]` on by default
</code></pre>
<p>Still, it is just a warning, and we can run the code without test failures just as before.
But RMC still catches the issue:</p>
<pre><code>** Results:
./src/lib.rs function estimate_size
[estimate_size.pointer_dereference.1] line 10 dereference failure: pointer NULL in *var_10: FAILURE

** 1 of 1 failed (2 iterations)

<p>Overflow (addition, multiplication, etc, and this case, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10183">bitshifting by too much</a>) is also caught by RMC:</p>
<pre><code>** Results:

<h2 id="assertions-assumptions-and-harnesses"><a class="header" href="#assertions-assumptions-and-harnesses">Assertions, Assumptions, and Harnesses</a></h2>
<p>It seems a bit odd that we can take billions of inputs, but our function clearly only handles up to a few thousand.
Let's codify this fact about our function by asserting some reasonable bound on our input, after we've fixed our bug:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn estimate_size(x: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    assert!(x &lt; 4096);

    if x &lt; 256 {
        if x &lt; 128 {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 3;
        }
    } else if x &lt; 1024 {
        if x &gt; 1022 {
            return 4;
        } else {
            return 5;
        }
    } else {
        if x &lt; 2048 {
            return 7;
        } else {
            return 9;
        }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now we have stated our previously implicit expectation: this function should never be called with inputs that are too big.
But if we attempt to verify this, we get a problem:</p>
<pre><code>** Results:
./tests/final-form.rs function estimate_size
[estimate_size.assertion.1] line 3 assertion failed: x &lt; 4096: FAILURE

** 1 of 1 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>We intended this to be a precondition of calling the function, but RMC is treating it like a failure.
If we call this function with too large of a value, it will crash with an assertion failure.
But we know that, that was our intention.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of <em>proof harnesses</em>.
Much like property testing (which would also find this assertion failure as a bug), we need to set up our preconditions, call the function in question, then assert our post conditions.
Here's a revised example of the proof harness, one that now succeeds:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[cfg(rmc)]
#[no_mangle]
fn main() {
    let x: u32 = rmc::nondet();
    rmc::assume(x &lt; 4096);
    let y = estimate_size(x);
    assert!(y &lt; 10);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>But now we must wonder if we've really fully tested our function.
What if we revise the function, but forget to update the assumption in our proof harness to cover the new range of inputs?</p>
<p>Fortunately, RMC is able to report a coverage metric for each proof harness.
Try running:</p>
<pre><code>rmc --visualize tests/final-form.rs
open report/html/index.html
</code></pre>
<p>The beginning of the report includes coverage information.
Clicking through to the file will show fully-covered lines in green.
Lines not covered by our proof harness will show in red.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try changing the assumption in the proof harness to <code>x &lt; 2048</code>. Now the harness won't be testing all possible cases.</li>
<li>Rerun <code>rmc --visualize</code> on the file</li>
<li>Look at the report: you'll see we no longer have 100% coverage of the function.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="failures-that-rmc-can-spot"><a class="header" href="#failures-that-rmc-can-spot">Failures that RMC can spot</a></h1>
<p>In the <a href="./tutorial-first-steps.html">last section</a> we saw RMC spot two major kinds of failures: assertions and panics.
If the proof harness allows some program trace that results in a panic, then RMC will report that as a failure.
We additionally saw very briefly a couple of other kinds of failures, like null pointer dereferences and overflow.
In this section, we're going to expand on these additional checks, to give you an idea of what other problems RMC will find.</p>
<h2 id="bounds-checking-and-pointers"><a class="header" href="#bounds-checking-and-pointers">Bounds checking and pointers</a></h2>
<p>Rust is safe by default, and so includes dynamic (run-time) bounds checking where needed.
Consider this Rust code (which can be found under <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/tree/main/rmc-docs/src/tutorial/kinds-of-failure/"><code>rmc-docs/src/tutorial/kinds-of-failure</code></a>):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Wrap &quot;too-large&quot; indexes back into a valid range for the array
fn get_wrapped(i: usize, a: &amp;[u32]) -&gt; u32 {
    if a.len() == 0 {
        return 0;
    }
    return a[i % a.len() + 1];
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We can again write a simple property test against this code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn doesnt_crash(i: usize, a: Vec&lt;u32&gt;) {
            get_wrapped(i, &amp;a);
        }
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This property test will immediately find the failing case because of this dynamic check.</p>
<p>But what if we change this function to use unsafe Rust:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>return unsafe { *a.get_unchecked(i % a.len() + 1) };
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now the error becomes invisible to this test:</p>
<pre><code># cargo test
[...]
test tests::doesnt_crash ... ok
</code></pre>
<p>But we're able to check this unsafe code with RMC:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[cfg(rmc)]
#[no_mangle]
fn main() {
    let size: usize = rmc::nondet();
    rmc::assume(size &lt; 4096);
    let index: usize = rmc::nondet();
    let array: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = vec![0; size];
    get_wrapped(index, &amp;array);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code># rmc tests/bounds-check.rs
[...]
** 1 of 468 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>Notice there were a <em>lot</em> of verification conditions being checked: in the above output, 468! (It may change for you.)
This is a result of using the standard library <code>Vec</code> implementation, which means our harness actually used quite a bit of code, short as it looks.
RMC is inserting a lot more checks than appear as asserts in our code, so the output can be large.
Let's narrow that output down a bit:</p>
<pre><code># rmc tests/bounds-check.rs | grep FAIL
[get_wrapped.pointer_dereference.5] line 10 dereference failure: pointer outside object bounds in *var_5: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that, for RMC, this has gone from a simple bounds-checking problem to a pointer-checking problem.
RMC will check operations on pointers to ensure they're not potentially invalid memory accesses.
Any unsafe code that manipulates pointers will, as we see here, raise failures if its behavior is actually unsafe. </p>
<p>Consider trying a few more small exercises with this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise: Switch back to the normal/safe indexing operation and re-try RMC. What changes compared to the unsafe operation and why?
(Try predicting the answer, then seeing if you got it right.)</li>
<li>Exercise: <a href="./tutorial-first-steps.html#getting-a-trace">Remember how to get a trace from RMC?</a> Find out what inputs it failed on.</li>
<li>Exercise: Fix the error, run RMC, and see a successful verification.</li>
<li>Exercise: Try switching back to the unsafe code (now with the error fixed) and re-run RMC. It should still successfully verify.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>Click to see explanation for exercise 1</summary>
<p>Having switched back to the safe indexing operation, RMC reports two failures instead of just one:</p>
<pre><code># rmc tests/bounds-check.rs | grep FAIL
[get_wrapped.assertion.3] line 9 index out of bounds: the length is move _12 but the index is _5: FAILURE
[get_wrapped.pointer_dereference.5] line 9 dereference failure: pointer outside object bounds in a.data[var_5]: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>The first is Rust's implicit assertion for the safe indexing operation.
The second is RMC's check to ensure the pointer operation is actually safe.
This pattern (two checks for similar issues in safe Rust code) is common, and we'll see it again in the next section.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Click to see explanation for exercise 2</summary>
<p>Having run <code>rmc --visualize</code> and clicked on one of the failures to see a trace, there are three things to immediately notice:</p>
<ol>
<li>This trace is huge. The standard library <code>Vec</code> is involved, there's a lot going on.</li>
<li>The top of the trace file contains some &quot;trace navigation tips&quot; that might be helpful in navigating the trace.</li>
<li>There's a lot of generated code and it's really hard to just read the trace itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>To navigate this trace to find the information you need, we recommend searching for things you expect to be somewhere in the trace:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search the document for <code>rmc::nondet</code> or <code>variable_of_interest =</code> such as <code>size =</code>.
We can use this to find out what example values lead to a problem.
In this case, where we just have a couple of <code>rmc::nondet</code> values in our proof harness, we can learn a lot just by seeing what these are.
In this trace we find (and the values you get may be different):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Step 23: Function main, File tests/bounds-check.rs, Line 43
let size: usize = rmc::nondet();
size = 0ul

Step 27: Function main, File tests/bounds-check.rs, Line 45
let index: usize = rmc::nondet();
index = 0ul

Step 36: Function main, File tests/bounds-check.rs, Line 43
let size: usize = rmc::nondet();
size = 2464ul

Step 39: Function main, File tests/bounds-check.rs, Line 45
let index: usize = rmc::nondet();
index = 2463ul
</code></pre>
<p>Try not to be fooled by the first assignments: we're seeing zero-initialization there.
They get overridden by the later assignments.
You may see different values here, as it depends on the solver's behavior.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Try searching for &quot;failure:&quot;. This will be near the end of the document.
Now you can try reverse-searching for assignments to the variables involved.
For example, search upwards from the failure for <code>i =</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two techniques should help you find both the nondeterministic inputs, and see what values were involved in the failing assertion.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="overflow-and-math-errors"><a class="header" href="#overflow-and-math-errors">Overflow and math errors</a></h2>
<p>Consider a different variant on the above function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn get_wrapped(i: usize, a: &amp;[u32]) -&gt; u32 {
    return a[i % a.len()];
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We've corrected the out-of-bounds access, but now we've omitted the &quot;base case&quot;: what to return on an empty list.
RMC will spot this not as a bound error, but as a mathematical error: on an empty list the modulus operator (<code>%</code>) will cause a division by zero.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise: Try to run RMC on the above, to see what this kind of failure looks like.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rust also performs runtime safety checks for integer overflows, much like it does for bounds checks.
Consider this code (from <code>tests/overflow.rs</code>):</p>

<p>A trivial function, but if we write a property test for it, we immediately find inputs where it fails, thanks to Rust's dynamic checks.
RMC will find these failures as well.
Here's the output from RMC:</p>
<pre><code># rmc tests/overflow.rs

[simple_addition.overflow.1] line 6 arithmetic overflow on unsigned + in var_3 + var_4: FAILURE

** 2 of 2 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the two failures: the Rust-inserted overflow check (<code>simple_addition.assertion.1</code>) and RMC's explicit overflow check (<code>simple_addition.overflow.1</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You could attempt to fix this issue by using Rust's alternative mathematical functions with explicit overflow behavior.
For instance, instead of <code>a + b</code> write <code>a.wrapping_add(b)</code>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/issues/480">at the present time</a>, while this disables the dynamic assertion that Rust inserts, it does not disable the additional RMC overflow check.
As a result, this currently still fails in RMC.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-classic-overflow-failure"><a class="header" href="#exercise-classic-overflow-failure">Exercise: Classic overflow failure</a></h3>
<p>One of the classic subtle bugs that persisted in many implementations for a very long time is finding the midpoint in quick sort.
This often naively looks like this (from <code>tests/overflow-quicksort.rs</code>):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn find_midpoint(low: u32, high: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    return (low + high) / 2;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>RMC immediately spots the bug in the above code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise: Fix this function so it no longer overflows.
(Hint: depending on which approach you take, you may need to add the assumption that <code>high &gt; low</code> to your proof harness.
Don't add that right away, see what happens if you don't. Just keep it in mind.)</li>
<li>Exercise: Prove your new implementation actually finds the midpoint correctly by adding an assertion to the test harness.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>Click to see solutions for these exercises</summary>
<p>A very common approach for resolving the overflow issue looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>return low + (high - low) / 2;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But if you naively try this (try it!), you'll find a new underflow error: <code>high - low</code> might result in a negative number, but has type <code>u32</code>.
Hence, the need to add an assumption that would make that impossible.
(Adding an assumption, though, means there's a new way to &quot;use it wrong.&quot; Perhaps we'd like to avoid that!)</p>
<p>After that, you might wonder how to &quot;prove your new implementation correct.&quot;
After all, what does &quot;correct&quot; even mean?
Often we're using a good approximation of correct, such as the equivalence of two implementations (often one much &quot;simpler&quot; than the other somehow).
Here's one possible assertion to make that obvious:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>assert!(result as u64 == (a as u64 + b as u64) / 2);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Since this implementation is just the original one, but cast to a wider unsigned integer type, it should have the same result but without overflowing.
When RMC tells us both of these methods yield the same exact result, that gives us additional confidence that we haven't overlooked something.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="future-work"><a class="header" href="#future-work">Future work</a></h2>
<p>RMC notably does not currently check the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Concurrency bugs, deadlocks, or data races.
It's possible RMC may be extended in the future to find such issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust type invariants.
For example, it's undefined behavior in Rust to produce a value of type <code>bool</code> that isn't <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
RMC will not spot this error (in presumably unsafe code), yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully generic functions.
To write a proof harness and call functions, they must be fully &quot;monomorphized.&quot;
This means we can't currently check a generic function (<code>foo&lt;T&gt;</code>) generically.
Proof harnesses have to be written specializing type parameters (<code>T</code>) to concrete types (e.g. <code>u32</code>), and check those instead.</p>
</li>

<p>Consider code like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn initialize_prefix(length: usize, buffer: &amp;mut [u8]) {

    for i in 0..=length {
        buffer[i] = 0;
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code has an off-by-one error that only occurs on the last iteration of the loop (when called with an input that will trigger it).
We can try to find this bug with a proof harness like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[cfg(rmc)]
#[no_mangle]
fn main() {
    const LIMIT: usize = 10;
    let mut buffer: [u8; LIMIT] = [1; LIMIT];

    let length = rmc::nondet();
    rmc::assume(length &lt;= LIMIT);

    initialize_prefix(length, &amp;mut buffer);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run RMC on this, we run into an unfortunate result: non-termination.
This non-termination is caused by the model checker trying to unroll the loop an unbounded number of times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Presently, <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/issues/493">due to a bug</a>, this is especially bad: we don't see any output at all.
You are supposed to see some log lines that might give some clue that an infinite loop is occurring.
If RMC doesn't terminate, it's almost always the problem that this section is covering, however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To verify programs like this, we really need to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an upper bound on the size of the problem.
We've actually already done part of this: our proof harness seems to be trying to set an upper limit of 10.</li>
<li>Tell RMC about this limit, if it's not able to figure it out on its own.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In the future, RMC may eventually support specifying <em>loop invariants</em>, which allow us to do away with fixed upper bounds like this.
That support is not ready yet, however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bounding proofs like this means we may no longer be proving as much as we originally hoped.
Who's to say, if we prove everything works up to size 10, that there isn't a novel bug lurking, expressible only with problems of size 11+?
But, let's get back to the practical issue at hand.</p>
<p>We can &quot;make progress&quot; in our work by giving RMC a global bound on the problem size using the <code>--unwind &lt;bound&gt;</code> flag.
This flag puts a fixed upper bound on loop unrolling.
RMC will automatically generate verification conditions that help us understand if that bound isn't enough.
Let's start with the &quot;sledge hammer&quot; by dropping all the way down to size 1:</p>
<pre><code># rmc src/lib.rs --cbmc-args --unwind 1
[.unwind.0] unwinding assertion loop 0: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>--unwind</code> is a flag to the underlying model checker, CBMC, and so it needs to appear after <code>--cbmc-args</code>.
This flag <code>--cbmc-args</code> &quot;switches modes&quot; in the command line from RMC flags to CBMC flags, so we place all RMC flags and arguments before it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This output is showing us two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>RMC tells us we haven't unwound enough. This is the failure of the &quot;unwinding assertion.&quot;</li>
<li>We aren't seeing other failures if we only unroll the loop once.
The execution can't progress far enough to reveal the bug we're interested in (which actually only happens in the last iteration of the loop).</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing an initial <code>--unwind 1</code> is generally enough to force termination, but often too little to do any practical verification.</p>
<p>We were clearly aiming at a size limit of 10 in our proof harness, so let's try a few things here:</p>
<pre><code># rmc src/lib.rs --cbmc-args --unwind 10 | grep FAIL
[.unwind.0] unwinding assertion loop 0: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>A bound of 10 still isn't enough because we generally need to unwind one greater than the number of executed loop iterations:</p>
<pre><code># rmc src/lib.rs --cbmc-args --unwind 11 | grep FAIL
[initialize_prefix.unwind.0] line 11 unwinding assertion loop 0: FAILURE
[initialize_prefix.assertion.2] line 12 index out of bounds: the length is move _20 but the index is _19: FAILURE
[initialize_prefix.pointer_dereference.5] line 12 dereference failure: pointer outside object bounds in buffer.data[var_19]: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>We're still not seeing the unwinding assertion failure go away!
This is because our error is really an off by one problem, we loop one too many times, so let's add one more:</p>
<pre><code># rmc src/lib.rs --cbmc-args --unwind 12 | grep FAIL
[initialize_prefix.assertion.2] line 12 index out of bounds: the length is move _20 but the index is _19: FAILURE
[initialize_prefix.pointer_dereference.5] line 12 dereference failure: pointer outside object bounds in buffer.data[var_19]: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>RMC is now sure we've unwound the loop enough to verify our proof harness, and now we're seeing just the bound checking failures from the off by one error.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise: Fix the off-by-one bounds error and get RMC to verify successfully.</li>
<li>Exercise: After fixing the error, <code>--unwind 11</code> works. Why?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="customizing-individual-loop-bounds"><a class="header" href="#customizing-individual-loop-bounds">Customizing individual loop bounds</a></h2>
<p>Setting <code>--unwind</code> globally affects every loop.
Once you know which loop is the culprit, it can sometimes be helpful to provide specific bounds on specific loops.</p>
<p>In the general case, specifying just the highest bound globally for all loops shouldn't cause any problems, except that the solver may take more time because <em>all</em> loops will be unwound to the specified bound.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise: Try increasing the unwind bound on the code from the previous section and then time how long solving takes.
For example, we see 0.5s at unwinding 12, and 3s at unwinding 100.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> RMC does not yet support annotating code with unwinding bounds.
What follows is a hacky way to make things happen, if you need it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In situations where you need to optimize solving time better, specific bounds for specific loops can be provided on the command line.</p>
<pre><code># rmc src/lib.rs --cbmc-args --show-loops
[...]

<p>This command shows us the mangled names of the loops involved.
Then we can specify the bound for specific loops by name, from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>rmc src/lib.rs --cbmc-args --unwindset _RNvCs6JP7pnlEvdt_3lib17initialize_prefix.0:12
</code></pre>
<p>The general format of the <code>--unwindset</code> option is: <code>label_1:bound_1,label_2:bound_2,...</code>.
The label is revealed by the output of <code>--show-loops</code> as we saw above.</p>

<p>It can be daunting to find the right place to start writing proofs for a real-world project.
This section will try to help you get over that hurdle.</p>
<p>In general, you're trying to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a place it'd be valuable to have a proof.</li>
<li>Find a place it won't be too difficult to prove something, just to start.</li>
<li>Figure out what a feasible longer-term goal might be.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>By far the best strategy is to follow your testing.</strong>
Places where proof will be valuable are often places where you've written a lot of tests, because they're valuable there for the same reasons.
Likewise, code structure changes to make functions more unit-testable will also make functions more amenable to proof.
Often, by examining existing unit tests (and especially property tests), you can easily find a relatively self-contained function that's a good place to start.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-proof-valuable"><a class="header" href="#where-is-proof-valuable">Where is proof valuable?</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where complicated things happen with untrusted user input.
These are often the critical &quot;entry points&quot; into the code.
These are also places where you probably want to try fuzz testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where <code>unsafe</code> is used extensively.
These are often places where you'll already have concentrated a lot of tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where you have a complicated implementation that accomplishes a much simpler abstract problem.
Ideal places for property testing, if you haven't tried that already.
But the usual style of property tests you often write here (generate large random lists of operations, then compare between concrete and abstract model) won't be practical to directly port to model checking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where normal testing &quot;smells&quot; intractable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="where-is-it-easier-to-start"><a class="header" href="#where-is-it-easier-to-start">Where is it easier to start?</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find crates or files with smaller lists of dependencies.
Dependencies can sometimes blow up the tractability of proofs.
This can usually be handled, but requires a lot more investment to make it happen, and so isn't a good place to start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't forget to consider starting with your dependencies.
Sometimes the best place to start won't be your code, but in code you depend on.
If it's used by more projects that just yours, it will be valuable to more people, too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find well-tested code.
Code structure changes to make code more unit-testable will make it more provable, too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things to avoid, when starting out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lots of loops, or at least nested loops.
As we saw in the last section, right now we often need to put upper bounds on these to make more limited claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Inductive data structures.&quot;
These are data of unbounded size.
(For example, linked lists and trees.)
Much like needing to put bounds on loops, these can be hard to model since you needs to put bounds on their size, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I/O code.
RMC doesn't model I/O, so if you're depending on behavior like reading/writing to a file, you won't be able to prove anything.
This is one obvious area where testability helps provability: often we separate I/O and &quot;pure&quot; computation into different functions, so we can unit test the latter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deeper call graphs.
Functions that call a lot of other functions can require more investment to make tractable.
They may not be a good starting point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant global state.
Rust tends to discourage this, but it still exists in some forms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="your-first-proof"><a class="header" href="#your-first-proof">Your first proof</a></h2>
<p>A first proof will likely start in the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nondeterministically initialize variables that will correspond to function inputs, with as few constraints as possible</li>
<li>Call the function in question with these inputs.</li>
<li>Don't (yet) assert any post-conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running RMC on this simple starting point will help figure out:</p>
<ol>
<li>What unexpected constraints might be needed on your inputs to avoid &quot;expected&quot; failures.</li>
<li>Whether you're over-constrained. Check the coverage report using <code>--visualize</code>. Ideally you'd see 100% coverage, and if not, it's usually because now you've over-constrained the inputs.</li>
<li>Whether RMC will support all the Rust features involved.</li>
<li>Whether you've started with a tractable problem.
(If the problem is initially intractable, try <code>--unwind 1</code> and see if you can follow the techniques in the previous section to put a bound on the problem.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've got something working, the next step is to prove more interesting properties than what RMC covers by default.
You accomplish this by adding new assertions.
These are not necessarily assertions just in your proof harness: consider also adding new assertions to the code being run.
These count too!
Even if a proof harness has no post-conditions being asserted directly, the assertions encountered along the way can be meaningful proof results by themselves.</p>

<p>Testing in RMC is carried out in multiple ways. There are at least
two very good reasons to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Software regression</strong>: A regression is a type of bug
that appears after a change is introduced where a feature that
was previously working has unexpectedly stopped working.</p>
<p>Regression testing allows one to prevent a software regression
from happening by running a comprehensive set of working tests
before any change is committed to the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software metrics</strong>: A metric is a measure of software
characteristics which are quantitative and countable. Metrics are
particularly valuable for project management purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend reading our section on <a href="rmc-testing.html#regression-testing">Regression Testing</a>
if you are interested in RMC development. At present, we obtain metrics based
on the <a href="./dashboard.html">RMC dashboard</a>.</p>
<h1 id="regression-testing"><a class="header" href="#regression-testing">Regression testing</a></h1>
<p>RMC relies on a quite extensive range of tests to perform regression testing.
Regression testing can be executed by running the command:</p>
<pre><code>./scripts/rmc-regression.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rmc-regression.sh</code> script executes different testing commands, which we classify into:</p>

<p>Note that regression testing is run whenever a Pull Request is opened, updated or merged
into the main branch. Therefore, it is a good idea to run regression testing locally before
submitting a Pull Request for RMC.</p>
<h2 id="rmc-testing-suites"><a class="header" href="#rmc-testing-suites">RMC testing suites</a></h2>
<p>The RMC testing suites are the main testing resource for RMC. In most cases, the
tests contained in the RMC testing suites are single Rust files that are run
using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>rmc file.rs &lt;options&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Command-line options <code>&lt;options&gt;</code> can be passed to the test by adding a special
comment to the file.
Read more about it in the <a href="rmc-testing.html#testing-options">Testingoptions</a> section.</p>
<p>In particular, the RMC testing suites are composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rmc</code>: The main testing suite for RMC. The test is a single Rust file that is
run through RMC. In general, the test passes if verification with RMC
is successful, otherwise it fails.</li>
<li><code>firecracker</code>: Works like <code>rmc</code> but contains tests inspired by
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">Firecracker</a> code.</li>
<li><code>prusti</code>: Works like <code>rmc</code> but contains tests from the
<a href="https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev">Prusti</a> tool.</li>
<li><code>smack</code>: Works like <code>rmc</code> but contains tests from the
<a href="https://github.com/smackers/smack">SMACK</a> tool.</li>
<li><code>expected</code>: Similar to <code>rmc</code> but with an additional check which ensures that
lines appearing in <code>*.expected</code> files appear in the output
generated by <code>rmc</code>.</li>
<li><code>cargo-rmc</code>: This suite is designed to test the <code>cargo-rmc</code> command. As such,
this suite works with packages instead of single Rust files.
Flags can be specified in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> configuration file.
Similar to the <code>expected</code> suite, we look for <code>*.expected</code> files
for each function under test.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have extended
<a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tests/intro.html"><code>compiletest</code></a> (the
Rust compiler testing framework) to work with these suites. That way, we take
advantage of all <code>compiletest</code> features (e.g., parallel execution).</p>
<h3 id="testing-stages"><a class="header" href="#testing-stages">Testing stages</a></h3>
<p>The process of running single-file tests is split into three stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>check</code>: This stage uses the Rust front-end to detect if the example is valid
Rust code.</li>
<li><code>codegen</code>: This stage uses the RMC back-end to determine if we can generate
GotoC code.</li>
<li><code>verify</code>: This stage uses CBMC to obtain a verification result.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a test fails, the error message will include the stage where it failed:</p>
<pre><code>error: test failed: expected check success, got failure
</code></pre>
<p>When working on a test that is expected to fail, there are two options to
indicate an expected failure. The first one is to add a comment</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// rmc-&lt;stage&gt;-fail
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>at the top of the test file, where <code>&lt;stage&gt;</code> is the stage where the test is
expected to fail.</p>
<p>The other option is to use the predicate <code>rmc::expect_fail(cond, message)</code>
included in the RMC library. The <code>cond</code> in <code>rmc::expect_fail</code> is a condition
that you expect not to hold during verification. The testing framework expects
one <code>EXPECTED FAIL</code> message in the verification output for each use of the
predicate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Note that <code>rmc::expect_fail</code> is only useful to indicate
failure in the <code>verify</code> stage, errors in other stages will be considered
testing failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="testing-options"><a class="header" href="#testing-options">Testing options</a></h3>
<p>Many tests will require passing command-line options to RMC. These options can
be specified in single Rust files by adding a comment at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code>// rmc-flags: &lt;options&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For example, to increase the unwinding value to 4 in a test, we can write:</p>
<pre><code>// rmc-flags: --cbmc-args --unwind 4
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, CBMC flags can also be passed using <code>cbmc-flags</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// cbmc-flags: --unwind 4
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>cbmc-flags</code> is likely to be deprecated in the near future. We
recommend using <code>rmc-flags</code> with <code>--cbmc-args</code> for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For <code>cargo-rmc</code> tests, the preferred way to pass command-line options is adding
them to <code>Cargo.toml</code> below the <code>[rmc.flags]</code> marker.</p>
<h2 id="rust-unit-tests"><a class="header" href="#rust-unit-tests">Rust unit tests</a></h2>
<p>These tests follow the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/unit_testing.html">Rust unit testing</a>
style.</p>
<p>At present, RMC only uses unit tests in the
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/tree/main/compiler/cbmc">cbmc crate</a>
to test the
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/blob/main/compiler/cbmc/src/goto_program/symtab_transformer/identity_transformer.rs">identity symbol table transformer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="script-based-tests"><a class="header" href="#script-based-tests">Script-based tests</a></h2>
<p>These are tests which are run using scripts. Scripting gives us the ability to
perform ad-hoc checks that cannot be done otherwise. They are currently used
for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard library codegen</li>
<li>Firecracker virtio codegen</li>
<li>Diamond dependency</li>
<li>Type mismatch</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, most of them are equivalent to running <code>cargo rmc</code> and performing
checks on the output. The downside to scripting is that these tests will always
be run, even if there have not been any changes since the last time the
regression was run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>cargo rmc</code> is under heavy development at the moment. Because of
that, this section may become outdated soon.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rmc-dashboard"><a class="header" href="#rmc-dashboard">RMC Dashboard</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="./dashboard/index.html">RMC Dashboard</a> is a testing tool based on <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-build-accumulator">Litani</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the dashboard to show the level of support in RMC for all Rust features.
To this end, we use Rust code snippet examples from the following general Rust documentation books:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rust Reference</li>
<li>The Rustonomicon</li>
<li>The Rust Unstable Book</li>
<li>Rust By Example</li>
</ul>
<p>However, not all examples from these books are suited for verification.
For instance, some of them are only included to show what is valid Rust code (or what is not).</p>
<p>Because of that, we run up to three different types of jobs when generating the dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>check</code> jobs: This check uses the Rust front-end to detect if the example is valid Rust code.</li>
<li><code>codegen</code> jobs: This check uses the RMC back-end to determine if we can generate GotoC code.</li>
<li><code>verification</code> jobs: This check uses CBMC to obtain a verification result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are incremental: A <code>verification</code> job depends on a previous <code>codegen</code> job.
Similary, a <code>codegen</code> job depends on a <code>check</code> job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-build-accumulator">Litani</a> does
not support hierarchical views at the moment. For this reason, we are
publishing a <a href="./dashboard/dashboard.txt">text version of the dashboard</a> which
displays the same results in a hierarchical way while we work on adding more
features to <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-build-accumulator">Litani</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before running the above mentioned jobs, we pre-process the examples to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the expected output according to flags present in the code snippet.</li>
<li>Add any required compiler/RMC flags (e.g., CBMC unwinding flags).</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we run all jobs, collect their outputs and compare them against the expected outputs.
The results are summarized as follows: If the obtained and expected outputs differ,
the color of the stage bar will be red. Otherwise, it will be blue.
If an example shows one red bar, it is considered a failed example that cannot be handled by RMC.</p>
<p>The <a href="./dashboard/index.html">RMC Dashboard</a> and <a href="./dashboard/dashboard.txt">its text version</a> are
automatically updated whenever a PR gets merged into RMC.</p>
<h2 id="the-dashboard-procedure"><a class="header" href="#the-dashboard-procedure">The dashboard procedure</a></h2>
<p>This section describes how the dashboard operates at a high level.</p>
<p>To kick off the dashboard process use</p>
<pre><code>./x.py run -i --stage 1 dashboard
</code></pre>
<p>The main function of the dashboard is <code>generate_dashboard()</code> in
<a href="https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/blob/main/src/tools/dashboard/src/books.rs"><code>src/tools/dashboard/src/books.rs</code></a>,
which follows these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it calls the different <code>parse_..._hierarchy()</code> functions which parse
the summary files for each book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>extract_examples(...)</code> function uses <code>rustdoc</code> to extract all examples
from the books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then for each example it will check if there is a corresponding <code>.props</code> file
in <code>src/tools/dashboard/configs/</code>. The contents of these files (e.g.,
command-line options) are prepended to the example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All examples are written in the <code>src/test/dashboard/books/</code> folder.</p>
<p>In general, the path to a given example is
<code>src/test/dashboard/books/&lt;book&gt;/&lt;chapter&gt;/&lt;section&gt;/&lt;subsection&gt;/&lt;line&gt;.rs</code>
where <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> is the line number where the example appears in the
documentation. The <code>.props</code> files mentioned above follow the same naming
scheme in order to match them and detect conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then all examples are run using
<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-build-accumulator">Litani</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the Litani log is used to generate the <a href="./dashboard/dashboard.txt">text version of the
dashboard</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Note that any changes done to the examples in
<code>src/test/dashboard/books/</code> may be gone if the dashboard is executed.</p>
